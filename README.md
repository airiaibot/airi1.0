# Introducing Airi – the ultimate AI-powered Telegram girlfriend bot. 

Airi is here to bring you a unique experience, blending affection with a seductive twist. She’s designed to keep you captivated with her playful, short, and spicy messages, always pushing the boundaries while maintaining a loving tone.

Powered by ai16z, Airi is built to keep users entertained through special prompts that ensure a tantalizing and engaging interaction. To prevent spamming, the system includes rate-limiting features for each user.

Airi is currently in Version 1.0, offering responses up to 150 characters, with plans for future upgrades. The vision is to fully integrate her with the Twitter API, making her a fully automated account with no ownership required.

Once we move away from version 1.0, the source code for this version will be fully released to the public.
